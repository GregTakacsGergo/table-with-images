Hello there!
I have been dealing with databases for a while, but I've always modified, created, deleted data. 
I mean data... datatipes which we typically use when manipulating databases, such as VARCHAR, INT, FLOAT 
and so on. We almost only have characters and numbers in our table cells. 
Now a little while ago, I had this strange idea, why not put something else in the cells, like files. 
Is it possible?
Well yes of course, maybe its intersting only to me, but yes we can have a table of let's images, and actually
we can make databases to deal with these files inside the tables. We have the BLOB datatype which I never really 
knew what it stands for. 
So now in this repo I'm going to create a database with images, using pythons mysql.connector module, firstly 
to get to know this module better because I think this is a very important connection between the two programming
languages, and secondly to show you that yes, it does work and it was fun to build this little project. Thank you!
